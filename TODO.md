2. INCORPORATE MONEY FOR BETTING, DEALER MATCHES ALL BETS PLACED WIN BET DOUBLES LOSE LOSE ALL BETS.

DONE
add in functionality check that if the active player has a A it can be used for which ever is higher without going bust

currently in the game an A is counted as a 1. this needs to be changed to count as an 10 unless it makes the player bust and then should count as a 1.

on each new card a check should be made to see if there is any A in the hand if so the first one should be changed to a 1 until all A are counted as 1 or there are none left.

create an array which keeps track of how many A are beinbg tracked as 10s, each time one needs to be changed remnove it from the array, if the player will still go bust check if they can change any As before declaring they are bust. -->
